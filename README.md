User List Web Page - ReactJS
This project is a simple web page developed using ReactJS that displays a list of users fetched from an API. It also shows the details of the selected user on the right-hand side column. The UI design can be found in the provided Figma link, but the actual implementation may vary.

Features :

--User List: The web page displays a list of users, each item containing the user's profile picture and name.

--User Details: When a user is selected from the list, the details of that user are displayed on the right-hand side column.

--Loaders/Spinners: Loaders are implemented while fetching data from the API to provide a seamless user experience.

--API Handling: Proper error handling is done for server errors or empty responses. Instead of breaking, a message "No data to show" is displayed.

--Lazy Loading: Images are lazy-loaded to optimize performance and reduce initial loading time.

--Search Bar: A search bar is added to find users by their names, making it easier to locate specific users.

--Pagination: Pagination is implemented to handle a large number of user names in the list.

--Phone Responsive : This site is responsive for smaller devices
